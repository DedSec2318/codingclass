          I am a student at City Arts and Technology High School.

          My interests are reading, writing, and video games. I read all kinds of books but I really enjoy writing history based fiction and fanfiction. Similar to my taste in books I have quite diverse palette for video games. I enjoy horror, fps, rpg, and rts games.I also love to explore the internet.

          My goals for college are to become a biomedical engineer and make a positive difference in the world. I aside from the usual college experiences I am really looking forward to the dormitory and study abroad experiences. I reallly want to take what I learn in college to help people.
